# EMR Config Builder

UNDER CONSTRUCTION -> It can be changed over this development process.

The main objective of this project is an easy manner to create a simple rest API using CDK and Python to generate EMR configurations based on this AWS [paper](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/blogs/big-data/best-practices-for-successfully-managing-memory-for-apache-spark-applications-on-amazon-emr/).

It can be helpful when you run your EMR clusters and need to generate configurations on the fly using an API.
